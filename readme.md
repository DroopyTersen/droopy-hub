# Hub Flow
Hub Flow is a pattern for managing state in React.js applications. It steals the great principles from Flux & Redux (one-way data flow), but leaves out the ceremonious complexity. Hub Flow comes with built in immutability, which means a huge performance boost and an end to accidental state mutation bugs.
Hub Flow is powered by Freezer.js

```
npm install --save hub-flow
```
